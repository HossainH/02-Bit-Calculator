  Instructions:
- You will be asked to enter the type of file you want to calculate bits for.
- Supported file types:
  - Image: Calculate bits based on image dimensions (width x height x 24 bits per pixel)
  - Text: Calculate bits needed to represent ASCII text (8 bits per character)
  - Integer: Calculate bits needed to represent a positive integer in binary
- You can enter 'image', 'text', or 'integer' (or their shortcuts) when prompted.
- To exit the program, type 'xxx' when it asks for the file type :)
- If you type 'i', you will be asked to choose if you mean an image or an integer.
